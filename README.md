# Palette Foundry

Palette Foundry empowers designers and engineers to build design systems without the headache of setting up and maintaining infrastructure.

Our mission is to provide robust, reliable tools so that product teams can focus on creating consistent, high-quality user experiences — not worrying about token pipelines, adoption metrics, or the underlying systems that support them.

## ✨ Key Features
Cross-platform token pipeline
Manage and distribute design tokens across web, iOS, and Android with consistency and confidence.

Adoption tracking & metrics
Understand how your design system is being used and identify areas for improvement.

Scalable support
Built to handle the complexity of growing, multi-brand, or multi-theme design systems.

## 📦 Projects
Palette Foundry is organized into separate tools and packages. Please refer to each repository for specific installation and usage instructions:

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
TypeScript for robust type safety

React for front-end tooling and demos

Node.js for CLI utilities and server tasks

## 🌐 Vision
Palette Foundry is a supporting organization: our goal is to help other teams build and maintain their design systems by providing a solid foundation of tools, frameworks, and metrics. We see ourselves as a helpful partner in the broader design systems ecosystem, complementing your existing processes — not replacing them.

## 🤝 Contributing
At this time, Palette Foundry is not accepting external contributions or support requests. Stay tuned for updates as our tools mature.
